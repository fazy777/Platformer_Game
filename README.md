Project Title:Platformer-Game

A high-performance Arcade built entirely from the ground up using Python. This project avoids external game engines to focus on pure logic, custom physics, and efficient state management.

🚀 Key Features
Pure Python Architecture: 100% Python-based logic with zero reliance on heavy game engines like Unity or Godot.

Custom Game Loop: Features a hand-coded loop handling input processing, state updates, and frame rendering.

Resource Management: Efficient handling of assets (sprites, sounds, and fonts) using pygame.

Modular Design: Separated concerns between game physics, UI components, and entity management.

🛠️ Built With
Python 3.x

Pygame/Arcade: For rendering and window management.

NumPy: For advanced coordinate calculations.

2. Technical & "Under the Hood" (Focus on Logic)
Use this if the game includes complex algorithms or unique mechanics.

Project Title: Platformer

A deep-dive into game development using only Python. This repository demonstrates how to handle complex game mechanics like collision detection and AI pathfinding without the "magic" of a pre-built engine.

⚙️ Technical Highlights
Collision Engine: Implemented AABB or Circle-based collision detection from scratch.

State Machine: A robust system to handle transitions between menus, gameplay, and "Game Over" states.

Optimized Rendering: Uses sprite layering and dirty rect updates to ensure smooth FPS on standard hardware.


Project Title: Platformer

A "from-scratch" recreation of the classic Platformer experience. Built using Python to explore the fundamentals of 2D game design.

No Engine, Just Code: Focuses on core programming principles.

Lightweight: Minimal dependencies and easy to run.

Extensible: Built with a class-based structure, making it easy to add new levels or characters.
